# Two Phase DPD Project
In this project a much more DPD system was created utilizing two types of particles. In this method particles were attracted to themselves more than their opposing type. As a result the like particles should clump. As seen below it is difficult to tell whether the particles are clumping.

However, by only visualizing one type of particle, it is very easy to see the grouping of the particles to create small pockets in the system.
