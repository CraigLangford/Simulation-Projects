# Random Number Generators
These projects focus on creating random numbers. This includes the linear congruential generator and the Fabonacci generator. 

## Linear Congruential Generator
A LCG is a random number generator that multiplies a previous value, adds to it and divides by a modulus (creating the range). This can be shown by the following equation:

The randomness is highly dependent upon the choice of values for the generator.
