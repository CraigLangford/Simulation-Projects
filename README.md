# Simulation Projects
These projects focus on utilizing different methods to simulate nanoenvironments. The READMEs in each folder further details the methods used. This includes some initial projects exploring various methods to generate random numbers, which is a powerful tool for the Monte-Carlo method as well as methods to create well dispersed particle systems. 

## Reading xyz files
From many of the simulations xyz files are produced. These can be visualized utilizing VMD or PyMOL, however, GIFs are included in the READMEs showing the resulting simulations.
